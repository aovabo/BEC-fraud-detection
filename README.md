# SafeWire AI - AI-Powered BEC Fraud Prevention

## **Use Case & Problem Statement**
### **Understanding the Threat: Business Email Compromise (BEC)**
**Business Email Compromise (BEC)** is a sophisticated cyber scam where attackers impersonate executives, vendors, or trusted parties to deceive businesses into making fraudulent financial transactions. 

### **Why is BEC a Critical Problem?**
- The **FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) reports that between October 2013 and December 2023, there were 305,033 BEC incidents**, leading to a **total exposed dollar loss of $55.5 billion**.
- In the U.S. alone, there were **158,436 victims** with **$20.08 billion in losses**, while **non-U.S. victims suffered $1.64 billion in losses**.
- **BEC scams are increasing**: Between December 2022 and December 2023, identified global exposed losses increased by **9%**.
- Attackers are now **using custodial accounts at financial institutions, peer-to-peer payment platforms, and cryptocurrency exchanges** to rapidly move stolen funds, making recovery difficult.
- The most common intermediary locations for fraudulent BEC funds in 2023 were **the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, China, Mexico, and the UAE**.

### **Current Solutions & Their Limitations**
1. **Email Security Tools (Proofpoint, Mimecast, Microsoft Defender)**
   - Detect phishing and email anomalies but **cannot stop payments**.
   - No integration with financial transaction systems.

2. **Manual Verification (Phone Calls, Double-Checks)**
   - Time-consuming and prone to human error.
   - Attackers exploit urgency and deception to bypass checks.

3. **Financial Controls (Spend Limits, Payment Delays)**
   - Effective but **inflexible and inconvenient** for businesses needing real-time transactions.
   - Cannot detect fraudulent intent in the request.

### **Why SafeWire AI?**
SafeWire AI bridges the **gap between AI-driven fraud detection and financial transaction security** by:
- **Using AI to analyze payment requests for fraud indicators before execution.**  
- **Integrating with Payman AI to enforce security measures on financial transactions.**  
- **Providing real-time alerts via Slack & Microsoft Teams, enabling instant human intervention.**  
- **Blocking payments to suspicious recipients until manually reviewed and approved.**  
- **Maintaining full audit logs for forensic tracking and compliance.**

## **How SafeWire AI Works with Payman AI**
### **What is Payman AI?**
Payman AI is an **infrastructure provider for AI-driven financial transactions**, similar to Stripe but built for AI agents. SafeWire AI integrates with Payman AI to:
- **Process payments securely** via USD financial rails.
- **Provide virtual financial accounts** for businesses without requiring direct Payman interaction.
- **Enforce spending limits, compliance, and audit logging** for all transactions.

### **How SafeWire AI Prevents BEC Fraud**
SafeWire AI does **not** require businesses (our customers) to create Payman AI accounts directly. Instead, the workflow operates as follows:

1. **A business signs up for SafeWire AI and links its bank account** (via Payman AI infrastructure).
   - The business is assigned a **virtual financial account** inside Payman.
   - This allows **AI-controlled transactions without customers directly using Payman**.

2. **SafeWire AI Fraud Detection Scans Payment Requests**
   - Analyzes emails for fraud risk (spoofed vendors, unusual requests, etc.).
   - Classifies transactions as **low-risk, medium-risk, or high-risk**.

3. **Transaction Decision Based on Risk Level**
   - **Low-risk transactions** → Approved automatically and processed via Payman.
   - **Medium-risk transactions** → Held for manual approval via Slack/Microsoft Teams.
   - **High-risk transactions** → **Blocked before reaching Payman AI**.

4. **Real-Time Slack/Microsoft Teams Alerts**
   - If a transaction is flagged, an alert is sent with **Approve/Reject** options.
   - Finance teams can **approve directly within Slack/Teams**, and Payman AI executes or cancels the payment accordingly.

5. **Execution or Blocking via Payman AI**
   - Approved transactions are **executed through Payman’s financial infrastructure**.
   - If rejected, the payment is **halted before any money moves**.
   - All transactions are **logged for compliance and auditing**.

### **Who Controls the Money?**
- **Businesses still own their funds**—SafeWire AI does not hold any money.
- SafeWire AI **only facilitates secure transactions** using AI fraud detection and Payman AI’s infrastructure.

## **Key Features**
- **AI-Powered Fraud Analysis** → Detects fraudulent payment requests before execution.
- **Automated Risk-Based Payment Processing** → Low-risk = auto-approved, high-risk = blocked.
- **Payman AI Virtual Accounts** → Securely holds customer funds without them directly managing Payman.
- **Slack & Microsoft Teams Integration** → Allows instant approvals or rejections by finance teams.
- **Full Audit Logging** → Ensures compliance and forensic tracking of all payment activities.

## **Example: Stopping a CEO Fraud Attempt**
### **Scenario:** An accounts payable employee receives an urgent email from their "CEO" requesting a **$50,000 wire transfer** to a new vendor.

1. **AI detects the email as a potential BEC fraud attempt.**
2. **AI halts the transaction before it reaches Payman AI.**
3. **A Slack alert is sent to the finance team:**

   **ALERT: Potential BEC Fraud Detected**  
   - **Vendor:** Fake Business Inc.  
   - **Amount:** $50,000  
   - **Reason:** Unverified payee, urgent request from spoofed CEO email.  

   **✅ Approve | ❌ Reject**  

4. **The finance team clicks Reject, and the transaction is permanently blocked.**
5. **The fraud attempt is logged in Payman AI’s compliance records.**

## **Edge Cases & Security Considerations**
- **Handling False Positives** – Provide an override option for finance teams.
- **Preventing Insider Fraud** – Log **who approved payments** in the system.
- **Multi-Layer Authentication** – Enforce **MFA for all high-risk payments**.
- **Preventing System Downtime** – Implement retries & failover handling for API failures.

---

## **Next Steps & Deployment**
- Deploy the backend on AWS Lambda / Vercel.
- Set up Payman API live environment.
- Expand detection logic with AI models trained on real BEC scams.
